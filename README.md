## Analysis Summary

To analyze Cyclistic bike-share usage, I followed the structured data analysis process using Excel. I worked with two cleaned datasets covering multiple months, merged them into a single file, and calculated the following key metrics:

- **ride_length**: Calculated by subtracting `started_at` from `ended_at` for each ride.
- **day_of_week**: Extracted using Excel's `WEEKDAY()` function to analyze weekly trends.

I conducted descriptive analysis using pivot tables:

- **Average ride length** for members vs. casual riders
- **Number of rides** by member type and day of the week
- **Average ride length** by day of the week

These insights allowed me to identify usage patterns that can inform marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.
