#### **1. Consistency in Casual vs Member Ride Lengths**:
- **Casual riders in both 2019 and 2020** tend to have **longer rides** compared to **Member/Subscribers**.

#### **2. Shift in User Behavior**:
- In **2020**, we may observe a **shift in behavior** due to factors like the pandemic or changes in user habits. You could analyze if casual riders tend to take shorter trips during weekends, or whether the trend of weekday rides for casual users is still prevalent.

# Conclusion

- Both in **2019 and 2020**, the **average ride length for Casual Riders is significantly higher** than for Members/ Subscribers.
- While the **weekly pattern** for casual riders remains fairly consistent, the exact **daily variations** may have shifted between the years (perhaps due to external factors like the pandemic in 2020).
- More data (such as **trip duration over a longer time period**) would be needed to draw further conclusions on shifts in user behavior over time.

# Next Steps for Analysis

1. **Further Segmentation**: Separate casual riders by frequency of usage to see if ride lengths differ for first-time vs regular casual users.
2. **Geographical Influence**: Analyze if **start and end stations** play a role in varying ride lengths.
3. **Time Series Analysis**: Look at how **seasonality** (e.g., months or seasons) impacts ride lengths and user behavior in both years.
