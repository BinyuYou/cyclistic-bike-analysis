# Project Overview

This project contains analysis on ride lengths for casual and member riders.

For detailed insights and conclusions, see the [Ride Length Analysis](ride_analysis.md).

# Ride Length Analysis Insights

### Key Insights:
1. **Casual riders** tend to have longer average ride lengths than **member riders** across all time periods.
2. The **Grand Total** for casual riders is much higher than for member riders, which might indicate that casual riders take longer trips on average.
3. **Ride length increases** in later periods (Columns 5, 6, and 7) compared to earlier ones, both for casual and member riders. For example, casual riders have a higher average ride length in Column 5 (**0.087402508**) compared to Column 2 (**0.051317134**).
4. The **overall Grand Total** (0.015357712) is a combination of both casual and member riders' data, but casual ridersâ€™ higher values skew this number upward compared to members.

### Conclusion:
This table provides a detailed breakdown of average ride lengths by rider type (casual vs. member) and different time periods (represented by columns). From the data, we can conclude that casual riders tend to take longer rides than members, and there seems to be a general trend of increasing ride lengths in the latter time periods. The overall grand total helps to give a sense of the average ride length across all categories.
